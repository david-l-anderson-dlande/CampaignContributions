# CampaignContributions
My solution(s) to the Insight Data Engineering February 2018 coding challenge.



# How to operate this

To be filled out when I'm "done" writing it.

Written in Python 3.5.2



# Development history

Nothing useful here, unless you're reading this for Data Insight Engineering; it may be useful then, if possibly rather verbose.


Strategy: first write unit tests to make sure I'm doing everything necessary.
Write code to pass them with the sample data provided by Insight (`itcont.txt`).
(I will probably need to add some cases for things they want to test.)

Once that is functional, download a large set from fec.gov, and work on performance.

Identify repeat donors, by combination of name and zip code, though only output zip code.

For a repeat donor, calculate total contribution, number of contributions, and compare to percentile input.
